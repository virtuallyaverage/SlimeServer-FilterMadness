# Bias 
A constant erroneous offset, unlike dynamic offsets caused by noise. ^bias-summary


# In-Run Bias

AKA bias instability, it is a measurement of bias drift given a constant Temperature. Generally the best accuracy possible in bias calculations. ^in-run-summary

# Turn-On Bias
Instability thermal, physical, mechanical, and electrical variations between start ups. ^turn-on-summary


# Temperature Bias
Bias changes due to changes in temperature, can be mapped but is tied to the Turn-On Bias ^Temp-summary
