Drift is the cumulative Inaccuracies in a IMU System. 
"The gyroscope drift is mainly due to the integration of two components: a slow changing, near-dc variable called bias instability and a higher frequency noise variable called angular random walk (ARW). These parameters are measured in degrees of rotation per unit of time. The yaw axis is most sensitive to this drift. A good portion of the pitch (attitude) and roll axis gyroscope drift can be removed within an IMU through the use of accelerometer feedback to monitor position relative to gravity. Filtering the gyroscope output within an IMU using a low-pass or Kalman filter is also a widely used method to cancel a portion of the drift error."
