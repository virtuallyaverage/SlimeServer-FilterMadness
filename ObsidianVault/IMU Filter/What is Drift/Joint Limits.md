We are modeling a human skeleton. It naturally has limitations for joint rotations, as well as likely actions and positions. (common sitting positions)
Either Triggering flags for recalibration, resets, skeleton modification, or even IK elements could be useful for finding and diagnosing other tracker issues.

Could also be useful for determining mounting maybe?
